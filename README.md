=======

CME4  is  said  to  cost estimation  tool type-4  which is  invented  by  wilmix  jemin  j  at  year  2017

for  estimating  RemoteWebapplication and   Highly  Advanced  Technology   used  in  WRIT or  SIT field.   


We  already  know  by  rogerpressman  but  cost estimation about remotewebapplication   is  not  included...



THE  COSTESTIMATION   FORMULAE  for  REMOTEWEBAPPLICATION
===========================================================


IF  Remotewebapplication  project  is  said  to be  normal....

PM =  7.5  *  (0.512) POW   1.12 

TDEV =  2.5 * (PM) POW  0.32
                                 ====>  1

TOTAL  NO  OF  PERSONS  =   PM /TDEV

for  eg)   if  you   use  CH$  technology  in  your project.




IF  Remotewebapplication  project  is  said  to be  Risk....

PM =  7.5  *  (0.512) POW   1.12 

TDEV =  2.5 * (PM) POW  0.32

                                 =====> 2


If  some  1/2  of  the    project   is normal  and 1/2  of  the  project  is  risk

total  cost estimation  =  (costestimation1 + costestimation2)/2

This    gives   the  correct   cost  for the  project...
